                <p>
                    Dial-up is a technology used to connect to the internet using a standard telephone line.
                    It works by dialing a specific phone number provided by an internet service provider (ISP) and
                    establishing a connection through a modem. Then, your computer uses the modem to convert digital
                    data
                    into analog signals that can be transmitted over a telephone line. These analog signals are then
                    sent
                    to the internet service provider’s (ISP's) equipment, which converts them back into digital data and
                    connects you to the internet.

                <p>
                    "Multilink dial-up" refers to a technology that uses multiple phone lines simultaneously to
                    establish a single
                    internet connection, essentially "bundling" the bandwidth from each line to achieve a faster overall
                    connection
                    speed compared to using just one line with standard dial-up internet. This technology is often used
                    by travellers.
                    Another name for a Multilink dial-up Internet connection is a crossover connection.The reason for
                    this is that this
                    connection may be interrupted by users or Internet service providers. People use ISP monitors to
                    monitor connection
                    data and bandwidth.

                    ISDN or Integrated Services Digital Network, is a circuit-switched telephone network system that
                    transmits both data and
                    voice over a digital line. You can also think of it as a set of communication standards to transmit
                    data, voice, and
                    signaling.
                    These digital lines could be copper lines. It was designed to move outdated landline technology to
                    digital.

                    The Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is used to transfer the internet through copper wire
                    telecommunication lines.
                    Splitters or DSL filters are used to split the frequency and make sure that it can’t get
                    interrupted. DSL is faster
                    than traditional dial-up connections. It is often the most accessible high-speed internet option for
                    users who live
                    in rural or remote areas.
                    There are 2 types of DSL: <br>

                    Fibre to the Home (FTTH) is the installation and use of optical fiber from a central point to
                    individual buildings
                    to provide high-speed internet access. FTTH uses optical fiber for most or all last-mile
                    telecommunications. Optical
                    fiber transmits data using light signals to achieve higher performance. Two types of systems enable
                    fiber optic cables
                    to transmit data using light and make FTTH possible: <br>

                    carpets. You may choose range extenders to expand the router’s network. Every single adapter acts as
                    a portable LAN port,
                    transmitting a wired and wireless network to any place in your home where there's an outlet.
                    Powerline adapters and
                    extenders must be deployed in a set of two or more and be connected to the same electrical circuit.

                    Satellite Internet access is Internet access provided through communication satellites; if it can
                    sustain high speeds,
                    it is termed satellite broadband. Modern consumer grade satellite Internet service is typically
                    provided to individual
                    users through geostationary satellites that can offer relatively high data speeds, with newer
                    satellites using the
                    Ku band to achieve downstream data speeds up to 506 Mbit/s. In addition, new satellite internet
                    constellations are
                    being developed in low-earth orbit to enable low-latency internet access from space.

                    Networks to combine
                    one xDSL network with a wireless network such as LTE. The technology is generic and can be applied
